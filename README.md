# PDF Extraction

This code is used to extract information from over 9k practical pdf files. Due to privacy concern, the data source cannot be shared.

## Feature
1. PDF Reading with PyPDF2 – Utilizes the PyPDF2 package to extract text from PDFs and saves the extracted content into text files for double-checking.
2. Accuracy Check Functions – Implements functions to validate the extraction of each section, ensuring data accuracy.
3. Data Categorization – Creates separate files to store:
  - Successfully extracted information
  - Entries that failed to meet extraction criteria
  - Entries flagged as potentially incorrect due to formatting issues

## Steps to Implement
1. Clone the repository
2. install the required packages through requirements.txt
3. Run the script

## Ongoing Improvements

The extractPDF.py script is being enhanced with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to improve efficiency and reproducibility.
